## ‚ùÑÔ∏è **What is Realtime Snowflakes?**
"Realtime Snowflakes" is a smart and visually delightful plugin that dynamically adds falling snowflakes to your website's footer based on **real-world weather data**. 

- **Configurable & Efficient**: Displays snowflakes *only* if the current temperature in your chosen city is below a defined threshold.  
- **Dynamic Snow Density**: The colder it gets, the denser the snowflakes fall. Stay cozy as your website adjusts in real-time!  
- **Global Awareness**: Automatically determines your website's city, or even fetches the location of your visitors using their IP address.  
- **Weather-Cached**: Optimized to cache weather data for 24 hours to minimize API usage, ensuring scalability across 1,000+ sites!

## üåü **Features**
1. **Live Weather Integration**:  
   Fetches real-time temperature using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

2. **Conditional Snowflake Display**:  
   Snowflakes appear **only** when the temperature falls below your defined threshold.  
   - Default: **40¬∞F**.  

3. **Dynamic Snowflake Density**:  
   Snowflake count increases dynamically as temperatures drop.  
   - **Base Snowflakes:** 12 at 40¬∞F.  
   - **Density Increase:** +1 snowflake for every 2¬∞F colder.

4. **Automatic City Detection**:  
   - Default to **Chicago, US**.  
   - Pulls the site's location if set via WordPress options.  
   - Determines visitor location via IP for a personalized experience.

5. **API Caching**:  
   - Weather data is cached for **24 hours** in `wp_options` to optimize performance and minimize API usage.

6. **Highly Configurable**:  
   All core settings are defined at the top of the script:
   - `WEATHER_API_KEY` ‚Üí Your OpenWeatherMap API key.  
   - `WEATHER_API_ENDPOINT` ‚Üí API URL.  
   - `TEMPERATURE_MINIMUM` ‚Üí Temperature threshold for snowflakes.  
   - `SNOWFLAKE_BASE_COUNT` ‚Üí Base density of snowflakes.  
   - `SNOWFLAKE_DENSITY_MODIFIER` ‚Üí Density scaling factor.  
   - `WEATHER_CACHE_DURATION` ‚Üí Cache duration (24 hours).  
   - `DEFAULT_CITY` ‚Üí Fallback city.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**
1. **Live Weather Fetch**:  
   Realtime Snowflakes queries the OpenWeatherMap API for the current temperature in your city.

2. **Intelligent Caching**:  
   - The API response is cached for 24 hours under the key `current_weather`.  
   - Avoids excessive API calls and ensures efficiency across all websites.

3. **Temperature Check**:  
   - If the temperature is **below the threshold** ‚Üí Snowflakes appear!  
   - Snowflake count scales dynamically based on how cold it is.

4. **Automatic Location**:  
   - Checks your site's city from `site_city` in `wp_options`.  
   - If unavailable, it tries to determine the visitor's city via IP.

   ```
3. Optionally set a **default city** for your WordPress site:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO wp_options (option_name, option_value) VALUES ('site_city', 'New York,US');
